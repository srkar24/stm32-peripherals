In this lab we: 
1.	Demonstrate how to use the STM32CubeMX tool to initialize the peripherals, build and generate your starting projects with the initialization C code using HAL libraries
2.	Create and configure the STM32CubeMX project and generate the initialization code
3.	Program and use HAL functions on the NUCLEO-L476RG board.
4.	Demonstrate familiarity STM32 HAL Library 
5.	Modify the auto generated CubeIDE source code to achieve a given goal  
6.	Used STM32 GPIO HAL to blink on board LED
7.	Used STM32 UART HAL to write Hello world to a serial terminal
8.	Used STM32 EXTI HAL to toggle on board LED with the on board push button
9.	Used STM32 DMA to transfer data on memory
10.	Used STM32 RTC with HAL to set alarms
11.	Used STM32 WDG and distinguish between WWDG and IWDG
