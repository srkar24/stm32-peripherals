**STM32 HAL Library Demonstrations**

This repository showcases various STM32 HAL Library functionalities implemented using CubeIDE for STM32 microcontrollers. Each example modifies the auto-generated CubeIDE source code to achieve specific goals using different HAL modules. We perform the following:

1. Use STM32 GPIO HAL to blink on board LED
2. Use STM32 UART HAL to write Hello world to a serial terminal
3. Use STM32 EXTI HAL to toggle on board LED with the on board push button
4. Use STM32 DMA to transfer data on memory
5. Use STM32 RTC with HAL to set alarms
6. Use STM32 WDG and distinguish between WWDG and IWDG

A demo video has been pushed to showcase the project.

Hardware used: STM32 L476RTG Nucleo board

Software used: STM32 CubeIDE
